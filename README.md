# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

For this lab, we are creating a website that can track a user's inventory. It allows the user to add items and records them onto a database. The user can choose to show the table, delete items, and add items.

## How to Run the Website
To run the website, the user can use the Live Preview function from VSCode. It is recommended the user open the website in the actual browser so alert messages can be seen if an incorrect input is given.
